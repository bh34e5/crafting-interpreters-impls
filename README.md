## Description

My implementations of the `lox` lanugage from the
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book.

I plan to follow along with the Java and C implementations, `jlox` and `clox`,
respectively.

And then I think I might try my hand at making an implementation in either
Common Lisp or Clojure.
